This is a WIP (work in progress)... a simple boilerplate to use when developing websites.
Build on the shoulders of giants...

  - Bourbon
  - Neat
  - Bitters (customised)
  - Vertical Rhythm (Compass)

I love to use bourbon, & neat... and so does this boilerplate, it also uses a customised version of bitters (where I've added my custom typography settings, as well as set-up a different vertical rhythm. 

It's not finished, and I'm still working on it... but having it here on Github means starting sites is a lot easier too...

Things to do...

  - change heading font-sizes to mixin so I can easily change 'modular-scale' on a per-project basis
  - add custom mixins for common tasks - (eg inline-lists, splash-img)
  - add resposnive nav (css / js) - collapsed on mobile, expanded on full view
  - and probably more, as I remember...
